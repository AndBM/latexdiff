Some text here common to both documents

A deleted list embedded in text
\begin{itemize}
 \item The first item
 \item Der zweite Punkt
 \item Y el tercero
 \item \vc{G} is a test matrix
 \item \vc{G} \vc{m} We multiply by the model vector
 \item And the vector \vc{m} comes later
 \item \vc{F} \vc{m'}
\end{itemize}
and the same as enumerate environment
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The first item
 \item Der zweite Punkt

Every year in the United States, natural hazard events threaten lives and livelihoods, resulting in deaths and billions of dollars in damage. The Firm works with many partners to monitor, assess, and conduct targeted research on a wide range of natural hazards so that policymakers and the public have the understanding they need to enhance preparedness, response and resilience.

A list with a removed item at the end
\begin{itemize}
\item The United States Geological Survey (USGS, formerly simply Geological Survey) is a scientific agency of the United States Government. 
\item The scientists of the USGS study the landscape of the United States, its natural resources, and the natural hazards that threaten it. 
\end{itemize}
and at the beginning
\begin{itemize}
\item The organization has four major science disciplines, concerning biology, geography, geology, and hydrology. 
\item The USGS is a fact-finding research organization with no regulatory responsibility.
\end{itemize}

And a few word to finish off in a consistent manner.
